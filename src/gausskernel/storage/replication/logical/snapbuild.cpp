 * snapbuild.cpp
 *
 *	Infrastructure for building historic catalog snapshots based on contents
 *	of the WAL, for the purpose of decoding heapam.c style values in the
 *	WAL.
 *
 * NOTES:
 *
 * We build snapshots which can *only* be used to read catalog contents and we
 * do so by reading and interpreting the WAL stream. The aim is to build a
 * snapshot that behaves the same as a freshly taken MVCC snapshot would have
 * at the time the XLogRecord was generated.
 *
 * To build the snapshots we reuse the infrastructure built for Hot
 * Standby. The in-memory snapshots we build look different than HS' because
 * we have different needs. To successfully decode data from the WAL we only
 * need to access catalog tables and (sys|rel|cat)cache, not the actual user
 * tables since the data we decode is wholly contained in the WAL
 * records. Also, our snapshots need to be different in comparison to normal
 * MVCC ones because in contrast to those we cannot fully rely on the clog and
 * pg_subtrans for information about committed transactions because they might
 * commit in the future from the POV of the WAL entry we're currently
 * decoding. This definition has the advantage that we only need to prevent
 * removal of catalog rows, while normal table's rows can still be
 * removed. This is achieved by using the replication slot mechanism.
 *
 * As the percentage of transactions modifying the catalog normally is fairly
 * small in comparisons to ones only manipulating user data, we keep track of
 * the committed catalog modifying ones inside (xmin, xmax) instead of keeping
 * track of all running transactions like its done in a normal snapshot. Note
 * that we're generally only looking at transactions that have acquired an
 * xid. That is we keep a list of transactions between snapshot->(xmin, xmax)
 * that we consider committed, everything else is considered aborted/in
 * progress. That also allows us not to care about subtransactions before they
 * have committed which means this modules, in contrast to HS, doesn't have to
 * care about suboverflowed subtransactions and similar.
 *
 * One complexity of doing this is that to e.g. handle mixed DDL/DML
 * transactions we need Snapshots that see intermediate versions of the
 * catalog in a transaction. During normal operation this is achieved by using
 * CommandIds/cmin/cmax. The problem with that however is that for space
 * efficiency reasons only one value of that is stored
 * (c.f. combocid.c). Since ComboCids are only available in memory we log
 * additional information which allows us to get the original (cmin, cmax)
 * pair during visibility checks. Check the reorderbuffer.c's comment above
 * ResolveCminCmaxDuringDecoding() for details.
 *
 * To facilitate all this we need our own visibility routine, as the normal
 * ones are optimized for different usecases.
 *
 * To replace the normal catalog snapshots with decoding ones use the
 * SetupHistoricSnapshot() and TeardownHistoricSnapshot() functions.
 *
 *
 *
 * The snapbuild machinery is starting up in in several stages, as illustrated
 * by the following graph describing the SnapBuild->state transitions:
 *
 *		   +-------------------------+
 *	  +----|		 START			 |-------------+
 *	  |	+-------------------------+			   |
 *	  |					|						   |
 *	  |					|						   |
 *	  |		   running_xacts #1					   |
 *	  |					|						   |
 *	  |					|						   |
 *	  |					v						   |
 *	  |	+-------------------------+			   v
 *	  |	|   BUILDING_SNAPSHOT	 |------------>|
 *	  |	+-------------------------+			   |
 *	  |					|						   |
 *	  |					|						   |
 *	  | running_xacts #2, xacts from #1 finished   |
 *	  |					|						   |
 *	  |					|						   |
 *	  |					v						   |
 *	  |	+-------------------------+			   v
 *	  |	|	   FULL_SNAPSHOT	 |------------>|
 *	  |	+-------------------------+			   |
 *	  |					|						   |
 * running_xacts		|					   saved snapshot
 * with zero xacts		|				  at running_xacts's lsn
 *	  |					|						   |
 *	  | running_xacts with xacts from #2 finished  |
 *	  |					|						   |
 *	  |					v						   |
 *	  |	+-------------------------+			   |
 *	  +--->|SNAPBUILD_CONSISTENT	 |<------------+
 *		   +-------------------------+
 *
 * Initially the machinery is in the START stage. When a xl_running_xacts
 * record is read that is sufficiently new (above the safe xmin horizon),
 * there's a state transation. If there were no running xacts when the
 * runnign_xacts record was generated, we'll directly go into CONSISTENT
 * state, otherwise we'll switch to the BUILDING_SNAPSHOT state. Having a full
 * snapshot means that all transactions that start henceforth can be decoded
 * in their entirety, but transactions that started previously can't. In
 * FULL_SNAPSHOT we'll switch into CONSISTENT once all those previously
 * running transactions have committed or aborted.
 *
 * Only transactions that commit after CONSISTENT state has been reached will
 * be replayed, even though they might have started while still in
 * FULL_SNAPSHOT. That ensures that we'll reach a point where no previous
 * changes has been exported, but all the following ones will be. That point
 * is a convenient point to initialize replication from, which is why we
 * export a snapshot at that point, which *can* be used to read normal data.
