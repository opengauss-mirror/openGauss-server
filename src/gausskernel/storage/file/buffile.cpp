 *
 * NOTES:
 *
 * BufFiles provide a very incomplete emulation of stdio atop virtual Files
 * (as managed by fd.c).  Currently, we only support the buffered-I/O
 * aspect of stdio: a read or write of the low-level File occurs only
 * when the buffer is filled or emptied.  This is an even bigger win
 * for virtual Files than for ordinary kernel files, since reducing the
 * frequency with which a virtual File is touched reduces "thrashing"
 * of opening/closing file descriptors.
 *
 * Note that BufFile structs are allocated with palloc(), and therefore
 * will go away automatically at transaction end.  If the underlying
 * virtual File is made with OpenTemporaryFile, then all resources for
 * the file are certain to be cleaned up even if processing is aborted
 * by ereport(ERROR).  The data structures required are made in the
 * palloc context that was current when the BufFile was created, and
 * any external resources such as temp files are owned by the ResourceOwner
 * that was current at that time.
 *
 * BufFile also supports temporary files that exceed the OS file size limit
 * (by opening multiple fd.c temporary files).	This is an essential feature
 * for sorts and hashjoins on large amounts of data.
