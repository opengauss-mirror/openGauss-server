 *
 * costsize.cpp
 *	  Routines to compute (and set) relation sizes and path costs
 *
 * Path costs are measured in arbitrary units established by these basic
 * parameters:
 *
 *	seq_page_cost		Cost of a sequential page fetch
 *	random_page_cost	Cost of a non-sequential page fetch
 *	cpu_tuple_cost		Cost of typical CPU time to process a tuple
 *	cpu_index_tuple_cost  Cost of typical CPU time to process an index tuple
 *	cpu_operator_cost	Cost of CPU time to execute an operator or function
 *
 * We expect that the kernel will typically do some amount of read-ahead
 * optimization; this in conjunction with seek costs means that seq_page_cost
 * is normally considerably less than random_page_cost.  (However, if the
 * database is fully cached in RAM, it is reasonable to set them equal.)
 *
 * We also use a rough estimate "g_instance.cost_cxt.effective_cache_size" of the number of
 * disk pages in openGauss + OS-level disk cache.  (We can't simply use
 * NBuffers for this purpose because that would ignore the effects of
 * the kernel's disk cache.)
 *
 * Obviously, taking constants for these values is an oversimplification,
 * but it's tough enough to get any useful estimates even at this level of
 * detail.	Note that all of these parameters are user-settable, in case
 * the default values are drastically off for a particular platform.
 *
 * seq_page_cost and random_page_cost can also be overridden for an individual
 * tablespace, in case some data is on a fast disk and other data is on a slow
 * disk.  Per-tablespace overrides never apply to temporary work files such as
 * an external sort or a materialize node that overflows work_mem.
 *
 * We compute two separate costs for each path:
 *		total_cost: total estimated cost to fetch all tuples
 *		startup_cost: cost that is expended before first tuple is fetched
 * In some scenarios, such as when there is a LIMIT or we are implementing
 * an EXISTS(...) sub-select, it is not necessary to fetch all tuples of the
 * path's result.  A caller can estimate the cost of fetching a partial
 * result by interpolating between startup_cost and total_cost.  In detail:
 *		actual_cost = startup_cost +
 *			(total_cost - startup_cost) * tuples_to_fetch / path->rows;
 * Note that a base relation's rows count (and, by extension, plan_rows for
 * plan nodes below the LIMIT node) are set without regard to any LIMIT, so
 * that this equation works properly.  (Also, these routines guarantee not to
 * set the rows count to zero, so there will be no zero divide.)  The LIMIT is
 * applied as a top-level plan node.
 *
 * For largely historical reasons, most of the routines in this module use
 * the passed result Path only to store their results (rows, startup_cost and
 * total_cost) into.  All the input data they need is passed as separate
 * parameters, even though much of it could be extracted from the Path.
 * An exception is made for the cost_XXXjoin() routines, which expect all
 * the other fields of the passed XXXPath to be filled in, and similarly
 * cost_index() assumes the passed IndexPath is valid except for its output
 * values.

 * comparisons for t tuples.
 *
 * If the total volume exceeds sort_mem, we switch to a tape-style merge
 * algorithm.  There will still be about t*log2(t) tuple comparisons in
 * total, but we will also need to write and read each tuple once per
 * merge pass.	We expect about ceil(logM(r)) merge passes where r is the
 * number of initial runs formed and M is the merge order used by tuplesort.c.
 * Since the average initial run should be about twice sort_mem, we have
 *      disk traffic = 2 * relsize * ceil(logM(p / (2*sort_mem)))
 *      cpu = comparison_cost * t * log2(t)
 *
 * If the sort is bounded (i.e., only the first k result tuples are needed)
 * and k tuples can fit into sort_mem, we use a heap method that keeps only
 * k tuples in the heap; this will require about t*log2(k) tuple comparisons.
 *
 * The disk traffic is assumed to be 3/4ths sequential and 1/4th random
 * accesses (XXX can't we refine that guess?)
 *
 * By default, we charge two operator evals per tuple comparison, which should
 * be in the right ballpark in most cases.	The caller can tweak this by
 * specifying nonzero comparison_cost; typically that's used for any extra
 * work that has to be done to prepare the inputs to the comparison operators.
 *
 * 'pathkeys' is a list of sort keys
 * 'input_cost' is the total cost for reading the input data
 * 'tuples' is the number of tuples in the relation
 * 'width' is the average tuple width in bytes
 * 'comparison_cost' is the extra cost per comparison, if any
 * 'sort_mem' is the number of kilobytes of work memory allowed for the sort
 * 'limit_tuples' is the bound on the number of output tuples; -1 if no bound
 * 'mem_info' is operator max and min info used by memory control module
 *
 * NOTE: some callers currently pass NIL for pathkeys because they
 * can't conveniently supply the sort keys.  Since this routine doesn't
 * currently do anything with pathkeys anyway, that doesn't matter...
 * but if it ever does, it should react gracefully to lack of key data.
 * (Actually, the thing we'd most likely be interested in is just the number

 * materialize the inner path.  It would be logically cleaner to build
 * separate paths testing these alternatives, but that would require repeating

 * that the executor need find only one match per outer tuple, and that the
 * mergeclauses are sufficient to identify a match.
